# BasicBash Terminal Emulator Project Update
## Will Thorbecke and David Abrahams

## Goal
Create a basic terminal like interface that allows a user to traverse their file structure using simple commands such as `cd` and `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`,
 
## Stretch Goal
Implement more advanced commands such as `grep`, `wc`, `sed`, `>`, `>>`, `command &`. Another stretch goal would have our commands work when files are large enough that we canâ€™t fit the entire thing into RAM (or, in the case our RAM is incredibly limited)

## Learning Goals (Will)
- Become more fluent at C
- Understand the inner workings of a terminal
- Better understand pointers

## Learning Goals (David)
- Get better at C
- Become fluent with memory management in C (allocation, deallocation, and pointer magic)

## Things that were helpful

We both spent a ton of time working on stack overflow. We didn't really have any specific useful resources. One page that stood out (because we did a lot of string-parsing work) was:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1088622/how-do-i-create-an-array-of-strings-in-c

The top 2 answers gave us code/syntax we used throughout the project.

## What we got done

### `cd` and `ls`

```
int ls() {
  DIR *d;
  struct dirent *dir;
  d = opendir(".");

  if (d) {
    while ((dir = readdir(d)) != NULL) {
      printf("%s\n", dir->d_name);
    }
    closedir(d);
    return SUCCESS;
  }
  return FAILURE;
}


int cd(char *loc) {
  if (loc == NULL) return FAILURE;

  char *curLoc = "./";
  char *directory = concat(curLoc, loc);
  int success;
  
  success = chdir(directory);
  free(directory);
  return (success == 0) ? SUCCESS : FAILURE;
}
```

We implemented these two simple directory traversing functions.

### An awesome Makefile/build system

We wrote a [Makefile](../Makefile) which uses implicit rules to compile all our source code to `.o`, and then link them together. It doesn't look that impressive, but we both actually understand the file, and can use the principles behind it on any future C project, which is exciting.


### Cool chaining via recursion

Our shell supports "pipeing" or sorts between commands (sort of). The code that actually does this is a little spaghetti-like (we're not proud of this), but here's the high level idea:

* User inputs a string. We split the string on `|`.
* If the resulting split-string has one-substring, we do that one command (ie, `cd ..`).
* If there arer multiple substrings, we recursively process the substrings, and feed the output from each command to the next in sequence.

For example, if my directory structure looks like:

```
dir1
 |
 --->dir2
      |
      -->file1.txt
```

and the shell is in `dir1`, `ls` produces `dir2`. We can do `ls | cd`, which feeds `dir1` to `cd`, and moves us into `dir2`. (We realize this is not actually how `|` works, it was just one way to get some functionality working in the time we had for this project).

### Tab completion

Our shell supports tab auto-complete. This allows a user to enter the begining of a filename or folder and press tab and have the shell autocomplete with a probable filename/directory.

An example of this is as follows:

```
willAndDave@basicBash:~/home/willem/Documents/School/SoftSys/BasicBash$ ls
.
README.md
src
.git
Makefile
basicbash
obj
reviewable.js
include
reports
..
.gitignore

willAndDave@basicBash:~/home/willem/Documents/School/SoftSys/BasicBash$ cd s
```

At this point, if the user presses tab, the shell will autocomplete the command as follows:
```
willAndDave@basicBash:~/home/willem/Documents/School/SoftSys/BasicBash$ cd src
```
Since `src` is the only entry that begins with 's'.

### Learning Goals Evaluation

#### David

I would say I ended up solidly in the middle. I got waaaaay more comfortable with pointers, as I got to write functions that took in `**char`, and it wasn't terrifying. C sometimes blows my mind still, and it seems like incredibly simple things are really tough. I also realized I'm still a little fuzzy on how function arguments work (and how functions can actually modify arguments in a way that is visible to the caller, ie, taking an input string and pointing it at another string).

#### Will

My understanding of pointers has steadily increased throughout the course of this project. It is not quite at the **point** where I'd like it to be, but I'm definitely way better off than I was at the start of this project. As for understanding the inner workings of a terminal, I think I fell a little short. Instead of calling commands such as `ls` and `cd` we wrote our own commands, which I felt provided us with more learning opportunity, but less of an understanding of how the bash shell works. Lastly, my overall comfort with C has increased a tiny bit. I ran into a lot of trouble with header files, specifically depricated libraries and libraries that weren't cross-platform compatible. This was especially the case when it came to commands such as `getch()` -- a command that allows us to monitor user key-input as opposed to just a buffer from `stdin`. This helped grow my overall understanding of debugging and C libraries.
