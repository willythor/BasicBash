## Goal
Create a basic terminal like interface that allows a user to traverse their file structure using simple commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` and `mkdir`,
 
## Stretch Goal
Implement more advanced commands such as `grep`, `wc`, `sed`, `>`, `>>`, `command &`. Another stretch goal would have our commands work when files are large enough that we canâ€™t fit the entire thing into RAM (or, in the case our RAM is incredibly limited)

## Learning Goals (Will)
- Become more fluent at C
- Understand the inner workings of a terminal
- Better understand pointers

## Learning Goals (David)
- Get better at C
- Become fluent with memory management in C (allocation, deallocation, and pointer magic)

## Resources
We plan on becoming more fluent in our use of everyday terminal commands using the UNIX tutorials posted on the SoftSys Google site.

## Tasks
1. Write a script that receives user input and looks like a bash shell (David)
2. Write a script that parses user input for commands such as `ls` and `cd` (Will)
3. Write a function that prints out all the files in a certain directory (Will)
